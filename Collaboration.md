# ü§ù Collaboration Statement

## Team Members
- **Miguel Matos** ‚Äî s240178@dtu.dk

- **Muhammad Owais Latif** ‚Äî s250184@dtu.dk

## Overview
This final project was completed collaboratively by all three group members as part of the course *Scientific Programming for Wind Energy* at DTU. The goal was to develop a Python package for short-term wind power forecasting using machine learning models.

We leveraged prior knowledge from an earlier assignment in this course that introduced basic AI techniques for time series prediction. This helped us establish a solid foundation for how to structure the models, preprocessing, and evaluation pipeline.

## Workload Distribution
We aimed to divide the workload as evenly as possible across all aspects of the project:
- **Planning and structure** of the package layout and overall workflow was done collaboratively.
- **Data preprocessing and feature engineering** were developed jointly, with everyone contributing to refining and testing the preprocessing pipeline.
- **Model development and tuning** was a shared effort, but **Muhammad** deserves special recognition for taking the lead on implementing, optimizing, and integrating the model training and prediction logic. His contributions to the coding structure and logic were particularly strong.
- **Evaluation and plotting** responsibilities were split, focusing on result visualization and final evaluation outputs.
- **README and documentation** were drafted and reviewed by all members, ensuring clarity and completeness.

## Code Structuring & Collaboration
The code was structured based on the team‚Äôs evolving needs. We emphasized modularity and clean separation of responsibilities:
- Each functional component (data loading, preprocessing, modeling, prediction, evaluation) was assigned its own file and class.
- We used Git for version control, working on feature branches and merging via pull requests after internal reviews.
- Frequent peer review sessions during the development process helped improve quality and avoid duplicated effort.

## Conclusion
All members contributed meaningfully to the project, and our collaboration was consistent and productive. We believe the final package reflects a solid group effort, both technically and organizationally.

Special credit: **Muhammad Owais Latif** ‚Äî for exceptional effort and coding contributions, particularly in model training and integration.
